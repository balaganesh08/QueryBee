Tacit, Explicit, Implicit… Wait, What? Let’s Break Down Knowledge Types

TL;DR: Types of Knowledge
Explicit knowledge: The stuff you can easily write down, share in documents, or teach directly. Think instruction manuals, textbooks, and company policies.
Implicit knowledge: The unwritten rules and context you pick up through experience. Not directly taught but understood within a culture, like knowing when to speak up in meetings or what certain phrases really mean in your workplace.
Tacit knowledge: The deep expertise that's hard to explain or transfer. It's your intuition and "just knowing" after years of practice, like a manager who instinctively knows how to handle difficult team situations.
Ever wonder why some colleagues seem to effortlessly navigate office politics while you're still trying to figure out the unwritten rules? 
Or why that new hire with impressive credentials struggles with tasks that seasoned team members handle with ease? 
The answer lies in the different types of knowledge we all possess and use daily. From the documented procedures in your employee handbook to the intuitive understanding of when to speak up in meetings, knowledge shapes every aspect of our work lives. 
Understanding the distinctions between implicit, explicit, and tacit knowledge could be the key to faster onboarding, better collaboration, and your next career advancement.
But, What is Knowledge?
Before diving into the various types, let's establish what we mean by knowledge. 
At its core, knowledge is the understanding, awareness, or familiarity acquired through experience, education, or discovery. 
It's the foundation upon which we build skills, make decisions, and solve problems.
Explicit Knowledge (The Written Word)
Explicit knowledge is perhaps the most straightforward type to understand. This is knowledge that has been documented, codified, or otherwise formalised. It can be easily shared, stored, and transferred between individuals.
Key characteristics of explicit knowledge:
Can be articulated, written down, or recorded
Easily transferable
Often found in books, manuals, databases, or standard operating procedures
Everyday examples:
A recipe for chocolate chip cookies
The owner's manual for your car
A company's employee handbook
Explicit knowledge is valuable precisely because it's accessible. When someone writes down the steps for changing a flat tire, that knowledge becomes available to anyone who can read the instructions, even if they've never changed a tire before.

Define Implicit (Understanding the Unspoken)
Implicit knowledge sits in an interesting middle ground. The term "implicit" means "implied though not plainly expressed." This type of knowledge is often embedded in routines, procedures, and shared understandings within a group or organization.
Key characteristics of implicit knowledge:
Not directly expressed but understood within context
Often embedded in organizational culture
Can be converted to explicit knowledge with effort
Usually learned through observation and participation
Everyday examples:
The unwritten rules of office etiquette (knowing not to microwave fish in the break room)
Understanding that certain phrases have contextual meanings ("We should get coffee sometime" might be a genuine invitation or just a polite way to end a conversation)
Knowing when to speak up or stay quiet in a meeting based on company culture
Being able to navigate your neighborhood without a map
To define implicit knowledge more precisely, it's the knowledge that exists beneath the surface—not directly taught but absorbed through experience and context. 
It's the "how we do things around here" knowledge that new employees pick up over time.

Tacit Knowledge: The Deepest Layer
While sometimes used interchangeably with implicit knowledge, tacit knowledge has distinct characteristics. This is the most difficult type of knowledge to transfer because it's deeply personal, experiential, and often difficult to articulate.
Key characteristics of tacit knowledge:
Highly personal and difficult to formalize
Rooted in individual experience, intuition, and values
Challenging to communicate or share with others
Often described as "know-how" or expertise
Everyday examples:
A chef who knows exactly when to remove food from heat without using a timer
A skilled musician who can play by ear
A doctor's ability to recognize subtle patterns in symptoms
A cat parent who can distinguish between different cries of the cat (or is that just me?)
Tacit knowledge is what separates novices from experts. It's the deep understanding that comes from years of practice and experience, often manifesting as intuition or "just knowing" how to do something.

The Relationship Between Explicit and Implicit Knowledge
Understanding the relationship between explicit and implicit knowledge is crucial for effective knowledge management. These two types exist on a continuum rather than as completely separate categories.
Explicit knowledge provides the foundation—the facts, data, and documented procedures. 
Implicit knowledge builds upon this foundation, adding context, nuance, and understanding. 
Together, they create a more complete picture of what we know and how we apply it.
Many organizations work to convert implicit knowledge to explicit knowledge through documentation processes, mentorship programs, and knowledge bases. 
This conversion helps preserve valuable insights when experienced employees leave and makes onboarding new team members more efficient.
Other Important Types of Knowledge

Imperative Knowledge: Knowing How
Imperative knowledge is often described as "know-how" or procedural knowledge. It's about knowing how to perform tasks or activities. This type of knowledge can contain both explicit and implicit elements.
Key characteristics of imperative knowledge:
Focused on procedures and processes
Often involves step-by-step instructions
Can include both formal and informal elements
Typically learned through practice and experience
Everyday examples:
Knowing how to ride a bicycle
Being able to cook a meal without following a recipe
Understanding how to navigate a complicated software program
Being skilled at negotiation techniques
Imperative knowledge is particularly valuable in practical situations where theoretical knowledge alone isn't sufficient. It's the difference between understanding the concept of swimming and actually being able to swim.
Declarative Knowledge: Knowing That
Declarative knowledge is about facts and information—knowing "that" something is true. This is often what we think of as academic or factual knowledge.
Everyday examples:
Knowing that Paris is the capital of France
Understanding that water boils at 100°C at sea level
Being aware that Abraham Lincoln was the 16th U.S. President
Procedural Knowledge: Step-by-Step
While similar to imperative knowledge, procedural knowledge focuses specifically on the steps required to complete a task. It can be both explicit (written procedures) and tacit (learned through experience).
Everyday examples:
Following a recipe to bake bread
Assembling furniture using instructions
Performing a complex dance routine
Conceptual Knowledge: Understanding Relationships
Conceptual knowledge involves understanding how ideas interconnect and relate to each other. It's about seeing the bigger picture rather than isolated facts.
Everyday examples:
Understanding how economic principles influence market behavior
Recognizing how different historical events are connected
Seeing relationships between mathematical concepts
Cultural Knowledge: Social Understanding
Cultural knowledge encompasses the shared values, beliefs, and practices of a group. It's often highly implicit and picked up through immersion rather than formal instruction.
Everyday examples:
Understanding appropriate greetings in different cultures
Knowing when humor is appropriate in professional settings
Recognizing important holidays and their significance
Workplace Challenges in Knowledge Transfer
Organizations face significant hurdles when trying to document and transfer different types of knowledge among employees. 
Let’s understand the key problems with each knowledge type and how a good knowledge management tool can help your company save valuable time and avoid losing insightful information.
Knowledge Type
Challenge
How a Good KM Tool Helps
Explicit Knowledge
Overloaded or scattered documentation
Provides centralized, searchable storage with smart categorization, filters, and tagging for quick access


Outdated information
Enables version control, auto-reminders for reviews, and assigns ownership for regular updates


Missing context in procedures
Allows rich formatting, comments, and contextual linking to related documents or real-world use cases


Siloed or hard-to-access information
Breaks down silos through cross-department access, workspace sharing, and permission-based collaboration


Lack of multimedia support
Supports embedding of images, videos, diagrams, and interactive content to enhance understanding
Implicit Knowledge
Employees unaware their knowledge is valuable
Encourages informal documentation via notes, discussion threads, and collaborative pages


Cultural knowledge fades with team turnover
Captures narratives, norms, and team rituals through wikis, blogs, or community spaces


Employees hesitant to share
Promotes collaboration through comments, reactions, and peer recognition systems


Observational learning lost in remote setups
Enables async knowledge sharing via screen recordings, annotated walkthroughs, and shared knowledge boards


Difficult to track or measure knowledge sharing
Offers analytics and activity logs to identify knowledge contributors, frequently used content, and gaps

But What about Tacit Knowledge
While modern knowledge management tools are helpful, they face a big challenge: capturing tacit knowledge.
When experienced employees leave a company, they take this valuable know-how with them. Even the best knowledge bases can't fully capture the richness of what these experts understand.
To save this important knowledge, companies need to do more than just write things down. They can try several approaches:
Apprenticeship programs where new employees work closely with experts
Recording experts talking through their thinking as they solve problems
Creating practice scenarios that mimic real challenges
Special interviews designed to help experts explain their instinctive knowledge
These methods help turn hidden expertise into something the company can keep, even after the expert has moved on.
